# Exercise 1  
Exercise 1 creates a list of ProteinEntry objects from a dictionary read from a uniprot JSON file and then defines three functions that take the list of ProteinEntry objects as input.  
# Exercise 2  
Exercise 2 converts the data from the uniprot JSON file to a CSV.   
# Exercise 3  
Exercise 3 converts the data from the uniprot JSON file to XML.  
# Exercise 4  
Exercise 4 converts the data from the uniprot JSON file to YAML.  
# Extra Note  
I named the JSON file with the uniprot data "uniprot_data.json". I wanted to make a note for this as my code uses this name when reading the JSON file, but the instructions for exercise 4 imply that you (the instructors) may have the name as something else.
